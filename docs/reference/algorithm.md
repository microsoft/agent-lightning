# Algorithm References

AgentLightning includes several popular and frequently requested algorithms in its built-in library, allowing agent developers to use them directly. These algorithms are designed to be compatible with most agent scenarios.

## APO

### Installation

```bash
pip install agentlightning[apo]
```

### Tutorials Using APO

## VERL

### Installation

```bash
pip install agentlightning[verl]
```

!!! warning

    For best results, follow the steps in the [installation guide](../quickstart/installation.md) to set up VERL and its dependencies. Installing VERL directly with `pip install agentlightning[verl]` can cause issues unless you already have a compatible version of PyTorch installed.
