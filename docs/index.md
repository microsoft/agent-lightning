## Features

- Turn your agent into an optimizable beast with **ZERO CODE CHANGE** (almost)! ðŸ’¤
- Build with **ANY** agent framework (LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, Microsoft Agent Framework...); or even WITHOUT agent framework (Python OpenAI). You name it! ðŸ¤–
- **Selectively** optimize one or more agents in a multi-agent system. ðŸŽ¯
- Embraces **Algorithms** like Reinforcement Learning, Automatic Prompt Optimization, Supervised Fine-tuning and more. ðŸ¤—

## How to Read this Documentation

This documentation is organized into the following parts:

- [Installation](tutorials/installation.md) - Get started with Agent Lightning
- How-to Recipes (e.g., [Train SQL Agent with RL](how-to/train-sql-agent.md)) - Practical examples of training agents and customizing algorithms.
- Learning More (e.g., [Debugging](tutorials/debug.md)) - Guides on specific topics like debugging or parallelization.
- Algorithm Zoo (e.g., [APO](algorithm-zoo/apo.md)) - References for built-in algorithms.
- Deep Dive (e.g., [Bird's Eye View](deep-dive/birds-eye-view.md)) - For a deeper understanding of what Agent-lightning is doing under the hood.
- API References (e.g., [Agent](reference/agent.md)) - References for the Agent-lightning Python API.
