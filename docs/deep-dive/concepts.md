# Core Concepts

## Agents

Agents are the fundamental units in Agent Lightning. They encapsulate:
- State management
- Task execution logic
- Learning capabilities

## Training

The training process optimizes agent behavior through:
- Reinforcement learning
- Supervised fine-tuning
- Self-improvement loops

## Tasks

Tasks represent units of work that agents can perform:
- Text generation
- Code analysis
- Decision making

## Monitoring

Real-time monitoring provides insights into:
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage
- Error tracking
