# VERL

!!! tip "Shortcut"

    You can use the shortcut `agl.VERL(...)` to create a VERL instance.

    ```python
    import agentlightning as agl

    agl.VERL(...)
    ```

!!! warning "Customization note"

    Customization of VERL is not supported as of current version. We recommend copying the source code from VERL and modifying it as needed to suit your requirements.

## Installation

```bash
pip install agentlightning[verl]
```

!!! warning

    For best results, follow the steps in the [installation guide](../tutorials/installation.md) to set up VERL and its dependencies. Installing VERL directly with `pip install agentlightning[verl]` can cause issues unless you already have a compatible version of PyTorch installed.
