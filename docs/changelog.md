* **Embedded Algorithms**: Algorithms are now embedded directly into trainers for simplicity.
* **New Execution Strategies**: Introduced *Client-Server* and *Shared Memory* execution models.
* **Trainer Updates**: Integrated v0.2 interfaces and FastAlgorithm validation.

### Documentation & Examples

* Revamped documentation with new guides for **agent creation**, **training**, **debugging**, and **store concepts**.
* Improved quickstart tutorials, clarified installation and new deep-dive articles.
* Added and updated examples: *SQL Agent*, *Calc-X*, *Local SFT*, *Search-R1*, and *APO algorithm*.

### Developer Experience

* Migrated build and CI pipelines to **1ES**, split workflows and aggregate badges for clarity.
* Adopted **uv** as the dependency manager.
* Added GPU-based pytest workflows for full test coverage.
* Enhanced debugging UX, pre-commit configs, and linting (Pyright fixes, import sorting).

### Ecosystem & Integrations

* Added support for agents built with [**Agent-framework**](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework).
* Added new community listings: [*DeepWerewolf*](https://github.com/af-74413592/DeepWerewolf) and [*AgentFlow*](https://agentflow.stanford.edu/).
