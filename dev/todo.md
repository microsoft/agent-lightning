# agl-lite Implementation Plan

> Aligned with the final architecture in `docs/design/0_architecture.md`
> and reviewed architecture decisions.

## Guiding Principles

1. **One repo, one package, two entrypoints**: `agl-lite serve` and `agl-lite controller`
2. **Controller talks to service only over HTTP** — no shared in-memory state
3. **Shared code limited to types/schemas** — both entrypoints import the same models
4. **Test each layer before building the next** — schemas → store → API → gateway → controller
5. **Freeze normative contracts early** — schemas, state transitions, auth matrix, event ordering

---

## Completed

- [x] **Phase 0**: Schemas, state transitions, project skeleton (Pydantic models, dev tooling)
- [x] **Phase 1**: In-memory store — rollouts (batch), events, resources, models, archive. 156 tests.
- [x] **Phase 2**: HTTP API — FastAPI app, auth, all store routes, gateway (config/router/proxy with wildcard + list-based routes), CLI, streaming SSE.
- [x] **Phase 3**: K8s controller — Python client, job builder, reconciler (create/watch/cancel/crash-recovery), CLI. 254 tests total.
- [x] **Phase 4a**: E2E with mock model server (CPU-only minikube). 271 unit tests + 9 e2e/cpu tests.
  - Kr8s adapter, `agl-client` CLI, deploy structure, example agents
  - `job_template` refactor (raw K8s pod spec, name-matched container overrides)
  - Math PoC mock mode: 2-iteration RL loop with weight update (v1→v2), streaming, deterministic rewards via `\boxed{}` embedding, model_request event validation, reference log
  - Scripts: `build_images.sh`, `deploy.sh`, `run.sh` (one-command E2E with log capture)
- [x] **Phase 4b**: E2E with real vLLM (GPU).
  - vLLM via Docker (`vllm/vllm-openai:latest`) on host GPU, reachable from minikube via `host.minikube.internal`
  - `scripts/start_vllm.sh` — convenience start/stop for vLLM Docker container
  - `rl_loop.py` — real algorithm: plain questions, numeric reward parsing, structural checks on streaming model_request events
  - Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct: 5/5 correct (100%) on GSM8K sample, 288 SSE chunks per response
  - Two self-contained `.env` examples (`.env.mockai.example`, `.env.vllm.example`), mode-aware `run.sh`
  - Reference logs for both modes (`reference_output.log`, `reference_output_vllm.log`)

## Phase 4a.7: Additional E2E scenarios [backlog]

Not on the critical path — the happy-path lifecycle is fully validated. Add when needed.

- [ ] **Cancel test**: enqueue → cancel mid-run → verify cancelled status
- [ ] **Retry test**: agent with `CRASH_ON_FIRST=1` → K8s Job retries → succeeds on second attempt
- [ ] **503 test**: agents hitting gateway during model deregistration window

---

## Phase 4b.3: Performance baseline [backlog]

- [ ] Measure: rollout throughput, gateway proxy latency overhead, event capture overhead
- [ ] Compare direct vLLM vs gateway-proxied vLLM

---

## Phase 5: Algorithm Integration (VERL)

**Goal**: Port VERL RL algorithm to consume agl-lite events. Assumes Phase 4b (real vLLM) is complete.

- [ ] Adapter: events → triplets (prompt, response, reward)
- [ ] VERL training loop using agl-lite API
- [ ] vLLM model server registration + weight update protocol
- [ ] Full RL training loop on minikube

---

## Phase 6: Polish

- [ ] Structured logging (JSON, with rollout_id/attempt_id context)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics (optional)
- [ ] Docker images for agl-lite serve and controller
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] User documentation beyond get_started.md

## Pre-Implementation Decisions (Frozen)

These are settled and should not be revisited during implementation:

| Decision | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Package layout | One package, two entrypoints |
| Controller-to-service communication | HTTP only, no shared memory |
| Store backend (MVP) | In-memory, single instance |
| Event ordering | Append order in per-rollout list, no sequence counter |
| `event_id` | Removed — events identified by position in list |
| `timestamp` | Assigned by store at write time |
| `job_template` | Raw K8s pod spec dict, loaded from YAML file. No typed schema — any valid K8s field works. `overrides` on `RolloutConfig` for per-rollout overrides. |
| Auth | Single `AGL_KEY` for all components, no role-based access for MVP. `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` trick for agents. |
| Health endpoint | `GET /healthz`, no auth |
| Error codes | 401 missing/invalid key, 404 rollout not found, 409 invalid transition |
| Archive format | JSONL, user-specified file path (`*.jsonl`). Append if file exists, create if not. Includes rollout + events + resources per archive call. |
| Gateway config | Static YAML at startup. List-based routes: `[{model_in, model_out, params}]`, first match wins. Wildcard support. |
| Model routing | Per-model round-robin. `(model, endpoint)` composite key. Version per server. Optional `token`. |
| Namespace | Single namespace per controller instance. Manifests omit namespace, applied via `-n`. |
| `timeout` / `max_retries` | Map to K8s Job `activeDeadlineSeconds` / `backoffLimit` |
| Agent auth injection | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env vars via `secretKeyRef` to `agl-lite-keys/AGL_KEY`. |
| vLLM deployment | Docker container (`vllm/vllm-openai:latest`) on host, separate from agl-lite lifecycle. `scripts/start_vllm.sh` for convenience. |
