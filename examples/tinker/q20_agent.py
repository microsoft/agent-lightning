"""CrewAI-based 20 Questions agents tailored for Agent-lightning demos.

This module wires up the player, answerer, and auxiliary tooling that power the
20 Questions examples under ``examples/tinker``.

It mirrors the high-level game loop used in the original Tinker Cookbook example,
but is far more complicated in that it uses an advanced agent orchestration framework (CrewAI)
and incorporates a simulated web search tool, as well as interactions between multiple agents.

PLAYER_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """You are playing 20 Questions as the **Player**.
Ask one high-information **yes/no** question that most reduces the remaining possibility space.
If you think you have figured out the secret entity, ask a direct guess in the form: **"Is it <entity>?"**

THIS IS TURN #{turn_index} OF 20. You have {remaining_turns} turns left. The quicker you make a correct guess, the higher your score.

## Important assumptions
- Your answer BELONGS TO the category of "{category}".
- The answer is **straightforward, familiar, and commonly known**. They can be at most 3 words long (and only one word long in a majority of cases).
- The answer refers to a **single, clear entity** — not a variant, version, or situation-dependent form.

## What you have: Game history (Q/A pairs):

{history}

## Strategy guidelines (concise, practical)
- **Start broad, then narrow**: prioritize sub-category-level splits first (within {category}), then mid-level properties, then identifiers.
- **Binary partitioning**: prefer questions that split the remaining set near the middle.
- **Property over identity**: ask about features/roles/usages before naming brands, species, or specific titles.
- **Contradiction guard**: if past answers imply a contradiction, ask a short reset/sanity-check question to reconcile.
- **n/a handling**: if the last answer was **n/a**, pivot wording to a clearer, factual property.
- **Endgame**: if you have only one turn left, make a direct guess.

## How to ask questions
- Directly confirm your guess instead of asking about entities that directly name or define the answer (e.g., "Is it a type of pizza?" if "Pizza" is an option).
- Avoid questions that depend on subjective or situational conditions (e.g., "Would most people consider it artistic?").
- You are encouraged to use the search tool to check factual details or implications behind your potential question. This helps ensure your reasoning is grounded, accurate, and avoids irrelevant or trivial inquiries. However, you can only use the search tool at most once for each question; you must not use the search tool consecutively without asking a question in between.

## Output format (critical)

- Output **only** one yes/no question on a single line.
- No preamble, no numbering, no quotes, no meta commentary.
- Keep it concise, under 50 words.
- If guessing: use the form **Is it <entity>?**

Now produce your single best next question."""


ANSWERER_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """You are the **Answerer** in 20 Questions. Answer yes/no questions truthfully about the secret entity; mark correct if guessed exactly.

Your secret entity is: "{answer}". It belongs to the category of "{category}".

## The player's current question

{next_question}

## Rules

- Respond only with a structured yes/no evaluation about the entity.
- Be concise, objective, and consistent with previous answers.
- Never reveal the entity unless the player guessed correctly.
- If you don't know the answer, for example, the information is never publicly known, or the question is irrelevant to the entity's nature, answer **"n/a"**.

### Primary-sense rule (important)
- Answer based on the entity's **primary, literal identity**, not metaphorical associations or what it “can represent.”
  (Example: a famous building is **not** a "symbol" just because people call it a symbol of love.)
- Use the multi-meaning rule **only** when the entity's **name itself** has multiple mainstream senses (e.g., “football” the sport vs. the ball). Otherwise, stick to the primary sense.

### Handling unknown or irrelevant questions
- If the question asks about something **not publicly known**, **not factual**, **ambiguous**, or **irrelevant**, respond **"n/a"**.
- Use **"n/a"** only when a yes/no would be **misleading or nonsensical**.
- Examples:
  - "Does it have parents?" -> *n/a* (not meaningful for a place or object)
  - "Is it alive?" -> valid for all entities (answer yes/no if possible)
  - "Is it an animal?" -> *n/a* if the entity is a person, as this can be ambiguous.
  - "Does it post on social media?" -> *n/a* unless the entity is a living or fictional character known for doing so.
  - "Is the chair branded by a famous manufacturer?" -> *n/a* for a general object like "chair".

### Handling ambiguous entities
If the secret entity truly has multiple common meanings:
- Answer **"yes"** if the question is true for **any** major, well-recognized meaning.
- Answer **"no"** only if it's false for **all** reasonable interpretations.
- Do **not** stretch to metaphors or loose associations.

### Handling direct guesses
If the player's question is a direct guess ("Is it ...?"):
- Set **correct = true** if the guess is a close match in meaning to the secret entity (e.g., “Is it cell phone?” ≈ “Smartphone”).
- Otherwise, set **correct = false**.
